Step-by-Step Plan for Completing Your Assignment
This plan assumes you've already worked on or are in the process of completing the Full-stack development Capstone project for the Cars Dealership web app. If not, prioritize finishing the project first, as all submissions depend on it. The assignment requires submitting specific artifacts (URLs, outputs, screenshots) via an online form or platform. I'll break it down into phases: preparation (completing the project), gathering evidence for each task, and submitting the assignment. Aim to document everything as you go—save files, take screenshots, and note outputs immediately to avoid rework.
Phase 1: Complete the Capstone Project
Before starting the assignment, ensure the project is fully built, tested, and deployed. Refer to the capstone's original instructions for details, but here's a high-level checklist based on the technologies mentioned (React, Django, Flask, Node.js, MongoDB, SQLite, Docker, Kubernetes, IBM Cloud Code Engine):

Set Up Version Control: Initialize a GitHub repository (public) for the project. Commit all code regularly. Include a README.md with the project name, description, setup instructions, and any other details.
Build the Backend:
Use Django for the main server (handling dealers, reviews, authentication).
Integrate Flask/Node.js for microservices (e.g., sentiment analysis, car makes/models).
Set up databases: MongoDB for reviews or unstructured data, SQLite for dealers/users.
Implement APIs for dealers (get all, by ID, by state), reviews (get by dealer, post review, sentiment analysis), user auth (login, logout, register).
Add admin functionality for root user management.

Build the Frontend:
Use React for the UI.
Create pages: Home (list dealers, filter by state), About Us, Contact Us, Sign-up (Register.jsx), Dealer Details (with reviews), Post Review.
Make it responsive with CSS. Include navigation bar, images, and forms.
Integrate with backend APIs (e.g., fetch dealers, submit reviews).

Implement Features:
User authentication: Login/logout, registration with fields (username, first/last name, email, password).
Dealer listings: Display branches, filter by state (e.g., Kansas).
Reviews: View/submit reviews, sentiment analysis (e.g., for "Fantastic services").
Car data: Fetch makes/models.
Static pages: About.html (team details), Contact.html (contact info).

Set Up CI/CD:
Use GitHub Actions for workflows (build, test, deploy).
Ensure workflows run successfully on commits/pushes.

Deploy the Application:
Containerize with Docker.
Orchestrate with Kubernetes.
Deploy to IBM Cloud Code Engine.
Get the public deployment URL.
Test deployed app: Landing page, login, dealer details, reviews.

Test Thoroughly:
Run local servers (e.g., Django server).
Use cURL for API testing (login, logout, get dealers, etc.).
Verify responsive design, sentiment analysis, admin login/logout.
Save all terminal outputs and screenshots as specified.

Document and Save Artifacts:
As you build, prepare files/outputs for the tasks below. Name them exactly as specified (e.g., django_server, loginuser).
Make GitHub repo public and note URLs for specific files.
Take screenshots with visible endpoints (browser address bar) where required.


If you're stuck on any project part, review course materials or debug step-by-step (e.g., check console errors, API responses).
Phase 2: Gather Evidence for Each Task
Once the project is complete, collect the required submissions. Go through these in order, as some depend on others (e.g., APIs need to be working for cURL outputs). Test everything locally and on the deployed version.

Task 1: Open your GitHub repo. Navigate to README.md. Copy the public URL (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/repo/README.md).
Task 2: Run the Django server locally (e.g., python manage.py runserver). Copy the terminal output showing it's running. Save as a text file named django_server.
Task 3: Update server/frontend/static/About.html with CSS links, images, names/roles/details/emails. Commit to GitHub. Copy the public URL of this file.
Task 4: Create/update server/frontend/static/Contact.html with CSS, nav bar (active on Contact), images, contact details. Commit. Copy the public URL.
Task 5: Use cURL to login (e.g., curl -X POST -d "username=validuser&password=validpass" http://localhost:8000/login). Copy command + output. Save as loginuser.
Task 6: After logging in (use token/cookie if needed), run cURL for logout (e.g., curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/logout). Copy command + output. Save as logoutuser.
Task 7: Ensure server/frontend/src/components/Register/Register.jsx has all fields and button. Commit. Copy the public URL.
Task 8: Run cURL to get reviews for a dealer ID (e.g., curl http://localhost:8000/api/reviews/dealer/123). Copy command + output showing review(s). Save as getdealerreviews.
Task 9: Run cURL to get all dealers (e.g., curl http://localhost:8000/api/dealers). Copy command + output. Save as getalldealers.
Task 10: Run cURL for a specific dealer (e.g., curl http://localhost:8000/api/dealers/123). Copy command + output. Save as getdealerbyid.
Task 11: Run cURL for dealers in Kansas (e.g., curl http://localhost:8000/api/dealers?state=Kansas). Copy command + output. Save as getdealersbyState.
Task 12: Access admin page (e.g., /admin), login as root. Take screenshot showing login success. Name: admin_login.png or .jpeg.
Task 13: Logout from admin. Take screenshot showing logout. Name: admin_logout.png or .jpeg.

14-15. Tasks 14 & 15: Run cURL to get all car makes/models (e.g., curl http://localhost:5000/api/cars—adjust port if Flask/Node). Copy command + output. Save as getallcarmakes. (Combined for 4 points.)

Task 16: Run cURL for sentiment analysis (e.g., curl -X POST -d "review=Fantastic services" http://localhost:5000/analyze). Copy command + output. Save as analyzereview.
Task 17: Open home page locally before login. Take screenshot showing dealers. Name: get_dealers.png or .jpeg. Include address bar.
Task 18: Login, refresh home. Take screenshot showing dealers, Review Dealer option, username, address bar. Name: get_dealers_loggedin.png or .jpeg.
Task 19: Filter dealers by state on home. Take screenshot with address bar. Name: dealersbystate.png or .jpeg.
Task 20: Open dealer page with reviews. Take screenshot with address bar. Name: dealer_id_reviews.png or .jpeg.
Task 21: Fill Post Review form (don't submit yet). Take screenshot. Name: dealership_review_submission.png or .jpeg.
Task 22: Submit review, view it. Take screenshot. Name: added_review.png or .jpeg.
Task 23: Trigger GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., push code). Copy terminal/output showing successful run (steps executed). Save as CICD.
Task 24: Get the IBM Cloud deployment URL (e.g., https://yourapp.codeengine.appdomain.cloud). Save in file named deploymentURL.
Task 25: Open deployed landing page. Take screenshot. Name: deployed_landingpage.png or .jpeg.
Task 26: Login on deployed app. Take screenshot showing username. Name: deployed_loggedin.png or .jpeg.
Task 27: Open dealer details on deployed app. Take screenshot. Name: deployed_dealer_detail.png or .jpeg.
Task 28: View a review on deployed app. Take screenshot. Name: deployed_add_review.png or .jpeg.

Phase 3: Submit the Assignment

Start the Assignment: Click "Begin the Assignment" on your platform (e.g., Coursera, IBM Skills Network).
Answer Questions: For each question (corresponding to tasks), paste the URL, output, or upload the file/screenshot as required. Double-check file names and formats.
Review and Submit: Go through all responses. Click "Submit Assignment".
Check Feedback: After submission, wait for grading (automated/manual). Review scores and feedback. If below 70%, retry (unlimited attempts)—fix issues in project and resubmit.

Tips for Success

Time Management: The estimate is 30 minutes, but gathering evidence might take longer if project isn't done. Allocate 1-2 hours.
Common Pitfalls: Ensure GitHub URLs are public and direct to exact files. Screenshots must show address bars/endpoints. cURL outputs should include both command and response. Test APIs with valid data.
Debugging: If something fails (e.g., API), check logs, database, and code. Use tools like Postman for cURL alternatives during testing.
Backup: Save all files in a dedicated folder. Version your repo.
If Stuck: Revisit capstone guides or seek clarification from instructors (don't share code here if prohibited).
