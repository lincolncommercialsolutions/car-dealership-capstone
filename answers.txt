========================================
TASK 22: Deployment to Kubernetes
========================================

Created Kubernetes deployment configurations for the application.

Implementation location: kubernetes/ directory

Kubernetes manifests created:
1. Django backend deployment and service
2. Flask sentiment analyzer deployment and service
3. Node.js car inventory deployment and service
4. ConfigMaps for application configuration
5. Secrets for sensitive data (database credentials)
6. Ingress for routing external traffic

Deployment configuration:
- 3 replicas for high availability
- Resource limits: CPU (500m) and Memory (512Mi)
- Liveness and readiness probes for health checks
- Service type: LoadBalancer for external access
- Persistent Volume Claims for database storage

To deploy to Kubernetes cluster:

1. Apply ConfigMaps and Secrets:
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/configmap.yaml
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/secrets.yaml

2. Deploy applications:
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/django-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/sentiment-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/inventory-deployment.yaml

3. Create services:
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/django-service.yaml
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/sentiment-service.yaml
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/inventory-service.yaml

4. Apply ingress:
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/ingress.yaml

5. Check deployment status:
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get services
   kubectl get ingress

The Kubernetes deployment provides:
- Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage
- Self-healing with automatic pod restarts
- Rolling updates with zero downtime
- Load balancing across multiple replicas
- Persistent storage for database data
- Environment-based configuration management


========================================
TASK 23: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
========================================

Created GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment.

Implementation location: .github/workflows/build-deploy.yml

Workflow Features:
- Triggers on push to main branch and pull requests
- Runs automated tests for Django backend
- Builds and tests React frontend
- Lints code for quality standards
- Runs on Ubuntu latest environment

Workflow steps include:
1. Checkout code from repository
2. Set up Python 3.12 environment
3. Install Django dependencies
4. Run Django migrations
5. Execute Django test suite
6. Set up Node.js environment
7. Install frontend dependencies
8. Run frontend tests
9. Build production frontend bundle

git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger CI/CD workflow"
git push

View workflow runs at:
https://github.com/lincolncommercialsolutions/car-dealership-capstone/actions

The workflow automatically:
- Validates code quality on every push
- Ensures tests pass before merging
